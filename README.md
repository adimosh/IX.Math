# IX.Math

## Introduction

IX.Math is a .NET library that reads mathematical formulas as text and creates delegates and delegate placeholders for solving them at runtime.

The library is capable of interpreting any mathematical expression that makes sense from a logical perspective, complete with a few mathematical functions. It
supports integer numbers (as [long](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.int64.aspx) in standard numeric formats), floating-point numbers (as
[double](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.double.aspx), strings (as [string](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string.aspx)) and
boolean (as [bool](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.boolean.aspx)) values, and can compute the most common mathemtic operations, as well as
certain mathematics functions.
